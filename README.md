# Getting started

This repository contains a sample application for users following the getting started guide at https://docs.docker.com/get-started/. as well as the dockerfile and docker-compose file provided in the getting-started tutorial, although slightly modified based on my preference to use npm as the package manager instead of yarn.

The application is based on the application from the getting started tutorial at https://github.com/docker/getting-started
